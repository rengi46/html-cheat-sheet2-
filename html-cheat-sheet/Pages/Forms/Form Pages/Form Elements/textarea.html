        <h2>textarea</h2>
        <p>The <code style="color:red">&lt;textarea&gt;</code> tag defines a multi-line text input control.The
            &lt;textarea&gt; element is often used in a form, to collect user inputs like comments or reviews.A text
            area
            can hold an unlimited number of characters, and the text renders in a fixed-width font (usually Courier).
            The
            size of a text area is specified by the &lt;cols&gt; and &lt;rows&gt; attributes (or with CSS).The name
            attribute is

            needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no
            data from the text area will be submitted).The id attribute is needed to associate the text area
            with a label.<br><br>
            <strong>Tip</strong>: Always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices!
